## How to Navigate

- Each week contains 5–7 daily folders
- Each day folder documents what was planned, executed, and learned
- A central progress log (`PROGRESS.md`) summarizes each day in one line

---

## Progress Tracking

Daily progress is tracked in:

- `PROGRESS.md` → high-level daily accountability
- `week_n/day_n/README.md` → detailed daily work and reflections

---

## Mentor Guidance

This challenge is conducted under mentor guidance with periodic reviews,
feedback, and course corrections.
